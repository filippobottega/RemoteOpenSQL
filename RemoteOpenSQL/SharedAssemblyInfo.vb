' Note that the assembly version does not get incremented for every build
' to avoid problems with assembly binding (or requiring a policy or
' <bindingRedirect> in the config file).
'
' The AssemblyFileVersionAttribute is incremented with every build in order
' to distinguish one build from another. AssemblyFileVersion is specified
' in AssemblyVersionInfo.cs so that it can be easily incremented by the
' automated build process.
